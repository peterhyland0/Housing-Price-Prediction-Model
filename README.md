# Housing Price Prediction Model
In this project, we look at the housing data of California. The data is loaded in and manipulated using Python code.
## Process
### Data Loading
The project begins by importing libraries and loading a dataset containing housing features and prices.
### Data Exploration 
Initial exploration involves checking data types, summary statistics, and visualizations to understand the dataset.
### Data Processing 
Missing values are handled, outliers are detected and addressed, and categorical variables are encoded.
### Feature Engineering
New features are created and existing ones transformed to enhance model performance.
### Data Splitting 
The dataset is divided into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.
## Models
### Linear Regression Model
A linear regression model is implemented, trained on the training data, and evaluated.
### Random Forest Model
A random forest regression model is implemented, trained, and evaluated for prediction accuracy, providing insights into feature importance.
